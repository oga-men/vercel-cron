# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new empty repository called `vercel-cron` with no existing codebase structure. The directory is completely empty and ready for initial project setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, standard setup commands will need to be established based on the project type that gets created here.

## Architecture

No architecture exists yet - this is a blank repository waiting for initial implementation.
